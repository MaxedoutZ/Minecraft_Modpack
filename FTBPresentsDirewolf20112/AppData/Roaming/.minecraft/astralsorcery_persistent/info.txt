Astral Sorcery's persistent data directory
Astral Sorcery stores various informations here to ensure they are persistent across several playthroughs
of different modpacks. Thus, no matter what pack you play, these files end up here.

Files saved here are saved in an NBT format and can't be opened directly on many systems.
See 'NBTExplorer' or related software to open and modify the files if needed.

Should you wish to disable some or all features accessing the permanent storage, check
Astral Sorcery's configuration file and disable all or individual features.
